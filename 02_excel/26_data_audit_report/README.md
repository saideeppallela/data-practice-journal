# 📊 Day 56 — Excel Data Audit & Error Detection Report

Today I worked on validating data instead of directly analyzing it.

I realized that even the best dashboards fail if the underlying data is incorrect, so I focused on building a simple audit system in Excel.

---

## 🧾 Business Scenario

I assumed the role of a Finance Analyst in an E-commerce company.

Problem:
Revenue and profit numbers in reports were not matching finance records.

So before doing any analysis, I focused on:
- Auditing the dataset  
- Identifying errors  
- Highlighting inconsistencies  
- Making the data reliable  

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains sales transaction details:
- Order ID  
- Order Date  
- Region  
- Category  
- Revenue  
- Cost  
- Reported Profit

## 📸 Raw Data Errors

## 🎯 Analysis Objective

To build an Excel audit layer that detects:
- Missing values  
- Incorrect profit calculations  
- Duplicate entries  
- Business rule violations  

---

## ⚙️ Analysis Process

### Step 1 — Convert to Table
- Used Ctrl + T  
- Named table: audit_data  

---

### Step 2 — Recalculate Actual Profit
Formula used:
=[@revenue] - [@cost]

---

### Step 3 — Profit Mismatch Check
Formula used:
=IF([@reported_profit]=[@actual_profit],"OK","Mismatch")

---

### Step 4 — Missing Values Detection
Formula used:
=IF(OR([@revenue]="",[@cost]=""),"Missing","OK")

---

### Step 5 — Duplicate Detection
Formula used:
=IF(COUNTIF(audit_data[order_id],[@order_id])>1,"Duplicate","Unique")

![Duplicate Check](day56_duplicate_check.png)

---

### Step 6 — Business Rule Validation
Rule: Profit should not exceed revenue  

Formula used:
=IF([@reported_profit]>[@revenue],"Error","OK")

---

### Step 7 — Audit Summary Table
Used COUNTIF to calculate:
- Mismatch count  
- Missing count  
- Duplicate count

---

### Step 8 — Conditional Formatting
- Red → Errors  
- Yellow → Missing  
- Green → OK

---

### Step 9 — Audit Dashboard
Calculated clean data percentage using:
=COUNTIF(profit_check,"OK")/COUNTA(audit_data[order_id])

---

## 📊 Analysis Output

The audit system successfully identified:
- Incorrect profit values  
- Missing revenue entries  
- Duplicate records  
- Logical errors  

---

## 💡 Business Insights

- Incorrect profit reporting can mislead financial decisions  
- Duplicate entries can inflate revenue numbers

## 🔍 Learning Reflection

Today I understood that data accuracy is more important than analysis.

If data is wrong:
- Insights become misleading  
- Decisions become risky  

This task helped me think like a real analyst who validates data before using it.
