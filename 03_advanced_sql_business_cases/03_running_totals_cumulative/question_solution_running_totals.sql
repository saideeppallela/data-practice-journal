-- INTERVIEW QUESTION
-- =========================================================
-- A company wants to track its cumulative sales performance.
-- Write a SQL query to:
-- 1. Calculate daily running total of sales
-- 2. Calculate monthly cumulative sales per category
-- 3. Calculate percentage of annual target achieved
-- =========================================================

-- STEP 1: Use database
USE sales_cumulative_db;
GO

-- STEP 2: Define annual target (business assumption)
DECLARE @annual_target DECIMAL(10,2) = 200000;
GO

-- STEP 3: Running total + cumulative analysis
WITH base_data AS (
    SELECT
        sale_date,
        category,
        sales_amount,
        YEAR(sale_date) AS sales_year,
        MONTH(sale_date) AS sales_month
    FROM daily_sales
),

running_calc AS (
    SELECT
        sale_date,
        category,
        sales_amount,

        -- Daily running total (overall)
        SUM(sales_amount) OVER (
            ORDER BY sale_date
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS running_total,

        -- Monthly cumulative per category
        SUM(sales_amount) OVER (
            PARTITION BY category, sales_year, sales_month
            ORDER BY sale_date
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS monthly_category_cumulative,

        -- Total yearly sales
        SUM(sales_amount) OVER () AS total_year_sales
    FROM base_data
)

-- STEP 4: Final output with percentage
SELECT
    sale_date,
    category,
    sales_amount,
    running_total,
    monthly_category_cumulative,

    -- % of annual target achieved
    (running_total / NULLIF(@annual_target, 0)) * 100 AS percent_of_target

FROM running_calc
ORDER BY sale_date;
GO
