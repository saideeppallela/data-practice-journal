-- A company wants to analyze delivery performance and revenue trends.
-- Write SQL queries to:
-- 1. Calculate average delivery days per ship mode
-- 2. Show quarterly revenue trend
-- 3. Compare Year-over-Year (YoY) sales
-- 4. Filter last 30 days data
-- =========================================================
-- =========================================================
-- 1. Average delivery days per ship mode
-- =========================================================

SELECT

    AVG(DATEDIFF(DAY, order_date, ship_date)) AS avg_delivery_days
FROM orders
GROUP BY ship_mode;

-- 2. Quarterly revenue trend
-- =========================================================

SELECT

    SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue

GROUP BY
