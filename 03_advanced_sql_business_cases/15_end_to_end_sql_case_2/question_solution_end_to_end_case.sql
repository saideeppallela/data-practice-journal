-- A company wants to clean messy sales data and
-- generate business insights for management reporting.
--
-- Build:
-- 1. Clean raw data
-- 2. Standardize fields
-- 3. Calculate KPIs
-- 4. Rank business performance
-- 5. Generate final actionable output
-- =========================================================

-- STEP 1: Use database
USE sql_analyst_case_db;
GO
