# 📌 Project Overview

This project is part of my **120 Days Data Analyst Learning Journey**, where I am learning Microsoft Excel for Data Analytics through practical projects and structured GitHub documentation.

For , I focused on learning **Advanced Date Functions in Microsoft Excel** using a realistic BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) HR dataset.

Instead of only practicing formulas, I tried to understand:

- how HR teams use date calculations in real organizations
- how Excel supports employee lifecycle reporting
- how date functions reduce repetitive manual work
- how business workflows can be automated using formulas

Functions practiced in this project:

- NETWORKDAYS
- EDATE
- DATEDIF
- WORKDAY

This project helped me move beyond syntax and understand practical HR analytics workflows.

---

# 🎯 Business Objective

HR and Operations teams in BFSI organizations frequently manage:

- employee joining dates
- probation periods
- annual review schedules
- notice periods
- project deadlines
- workforce tenure tracking

Manually calculating dates across large employee datasets becomes repetitive and error-prone.

The objective of this project was to understand how Excel Date Functions can automate HR reporting workflows and improve analytical efficiency.

---

# 🗂 Dataset Information

A **2000-row Indian BFSI HR dataset** was created for this project.

### Dataset Columns

| Column Name | Description |
|---|---|
| EmpID | Employee ID |
| Employee_Name | Employee name |
| Department | Employee department |
| Join_Date | Employee joining date |
| Date_of_Birth | Employee date of birth |
| Project_Start | Project start date |
| Project_End | Project end date |
| Status | Employee status |

Departments included:

- Finance
- Operations
- Technology
- Risk
- Compliance

---

# ⚙️ Excel Workflow

## 1️⃣ Dataset Preparation

- Imported HR dataset
- Converted raw data into Excel Table
- Named table as `HRTable`
- Verified date formatting

---

## 2️⃣ Working Day Analysis using NETWORKDAYS

### Formula Used

```excel
=NETWORKDAYS([@Project_Start],[@Project_End])
```

### Holiday Version

```excel
=NETWORKDAYS([@Project_Start],[@Project_End],Holiday_List!A:A)
```

### Business Understanding

Banks and insurance companies use working-day calculations for:

- project deadlines
- audit schedules
- compliance reporting
- employee planning

---

## 3️⃣ Probation & Review Date Tracking using EDATE

### Probation End

```excel
=EDATE([@Join_Date],3)
```

### Annual Review Date

```excel
=EDATE([@Join_Date],12)
```

### Learning

I understood how future business dates can be generated automatically rather than calculated manually.

---

## 4️⃣ Business Day Calculation using WORKDAY

### Formula Used

```excel
=WORKDAY(TODAY(),30)
```

### Learning

WORKDAY automatically skips:

✅ Saturday  
✅ Sunday  

This removes manual effort while calculating future business dates.

---

## 5️⃣ Employee Tenure Analysis using DATEDIF

### Formula Used

```excel
=DATEDIF([@Join_Date],TODAY(),"Y")
```

---

# ⭐ Important Learning — DATEDIF is Undocumented

One of the most interesting things I learned today was that **DATEDIF is an undocumented Excel function.**

This means:

Microsoft still supports the function, but it does not officially appear in formula suggestions or autocomplete.

I found this especially interesting because it is still widely used in HR analytics and interview scenarios.

---

### DATEDIF Codes Practiced

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| "Y" | Completed years |
| "M" | Completed months |
| "D" | Total days |
| "YM" | Remaining months excluding years |
| "MD" | Remaining days excluding months |

---

## 6️⃣ Employee Tenure Display

### Formula Used

```excel
=DATEDIF([@Join_Date],TODAY(),"Y")&" yrs "&DATEDIF([@Join_Date],TODAY(),"YM")&" months"
```

Example:

```text
4 yrs 7 months
```

This made employee tenure easier to understand inside HR reports.

---

## 7️⃣ Employee Age Analysis

### Formula Used

```excel
=DATEDIF([@Date_of_Birth],TODAY(),"Y")
```

Used for age-based employee reporting.
