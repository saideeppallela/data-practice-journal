# — Power Query Basics in Microsoft Excel for Data Analytics | Excel Data Cleaning & Automation Project

## 📌 Project Introduction

As part of my Data Analyst learning journey, I worked on a hands-on Microsoft Excel Power Query project focused on importing, cleaning, transforming, and loading messy business data.

In many real-world companies, analysts receive raw CSV or Excel files containing:
- duplicate records,
- inconsistent text formatting,
- blank values,
- incorrect data types,
- and messy date formats.

Instead of cleaning such data manually every day, I used Power Query in Excel to build a reusable data cleaning workflow that can refresh automatically whenever the source CSV file changes.

This project helped me better understand how Excel automation improves reporting efficiency and reduces repetitive manual work in Data Analytics workflows.

# 🎯 Business Problem / Objective

The objective of this project was to simulate a realistic business scenario where a sales dataset arrives in an unclean format.

The dataset intentionally included:
- Duplicate rows
- Mixed region capitalization
- Extra spaces in product names
- Numbers stored as text
- Mixed date formats
- Blank values

The goal was to clean and standardize the dataset using Power Query instead of manual Excel operations.

This project focused on building a repeatable and refreshable Excel data cleaning workflow commonly used in Business Analytics and reporting environments.

# 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project represents a small sales transaction dataset containing common data quality issues.

### Dataset Columns

| Column Name | Description |
|---|---|
| OrderID | Unique order identifier |
| Product | Product category |
| Region | Sales region |
| OrderDate | Date of order |
| Sales_Amount | Sales value |
| Customer_Name | Customer name |

---

# ⚠️ Data Problems Intentionally Included

| Problem | Example |
|---|---|
| Duplicate Rows | Same orders repeated |
| Mixed Capitalization | NORTH / north / North |
| Extra Spaces | " Laptop " |
| Blank Values | Empty Region rows |
| Mixed Date Formats | DD/MM/YYYY and DD-MMM-YYYY |
| Numbers Stored as Text | "1,25,000" |

# 🛠 Step-by-Step Power Query Workflow

## Step 1 — Import CSV into Power Query
- Opened CSV using:
  - DATA → Get Data → From Text/CSV
- Loaded dataset into Power Query Editor

---

## Step 2 — Remove Duplicate Rows
- Used:
  - Home → Remove Rows → Remove Duplicates
- Removed repeated transaction records

---

## Step 3 — Standardize Region Values
- Converted:
  - NORTH
  - north
  - North
- Into one consistent format:
  - North

Used:
- Transform → Format → Capitalize Each Word

---

## Step 4 — Clean Product Column
Removed:
- Extra spaces
- Hidden characters

Used:
- Transform → Format → Trim
- Transform → Format → Clean

---

## Step 5 — Convert Sales Amount to Numeric
The sales values were stored as text with commas.

Example:
- "1,25,000"

Actions performed:
- Replaced commas
- Changed column type to Whole Number

---

## Step 6 — Standardize Date Format
The dataset contained mixed date formats.

Used:
- Transform → Data Type → Using Locale

Converted all dates into a consistent Excel Date format.

---

## Step 7 — Remove Blank Region Rows
Filtered out incomplete records using column filters.

---

## Step 8 — Load Cleaned Data into Excel
Used:
- Close & Load

Loaded the transformed dataset back into Excel for reporting and future analysis.
